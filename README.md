# world-o-techno

Hack on the awesome original [world-o-techno](https://github.com/jarkman/world-o-techno) by jarkman.
See http://www.jarkman.co.uk/catalog/robots/worldotechno.htm for hardware details of the original.

## Modifications

Missing the sweet dulcet sounds of techno after CCCamp, I modded the code to walk lines of GPS coordinates.
(Possibly. My Ruby is non-existent, this is mostly guesswork. Contributions, especially adding support for
actual path formats like GPX, are more than welcome).

## Getting started:

Open [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/). Copy the code in ``./world-o-techno.rb``. Set different waypoints, if you wanna.
Press play, walk away â€¦
